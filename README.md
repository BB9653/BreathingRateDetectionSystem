# Breathing Rate Detection System
Breathing Rate Detection System using Digital Signal Processing techniques. Uses a LM61 temperature sensor and programmed on a Yourduino Red. Primary goal is to monitor respiratory rates in children aged 11 months to 5 years and provide visual warnings in case of abnormal breathing rates, potentially indicating acute respiratory infections such as pneumonia.

## System Specifications
The breathing rate monitor is designed to meet the following specifications:
- Normal Breathing Rate: 12-39 breaths per minute(Green LED flashed)
- High Breathing Rate: 40 breaths per minute(Red LED flashed)
- Low Breathing Rate: 0 - 12 breaths per minute (yellow LED flashed)
